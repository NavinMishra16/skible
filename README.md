##  Key Fixes

###  1. Room ID Overwriting Fix
- **Issue:** Whenever any player created a room, a new `RoomResponse` with a fresh UUID was returned, potentially overwriting the existing room.
- **Fix:** Separated room initialization logic to avoid regenerating the `roomId` if it already exists. Now the host's room ID is preserved and reused properly.

### 2. Host Player Not Added to Game State
- **Issue:** The host (creator) was not automatically added to the `GameState`, causing `startGame` to fail due to insufficient players.
- **Fix:** Updated the `createRoom` logic to add the host player to both the room and the corresponding game state immediately during initialization.

### 3.GameState Switching twice while playing 
- **Issue:** The host (creator) was always picking up the word and guest (player 2) was always gueeessing
- **Fix** : Added the decriptive answer in [Feature]#1
